# Low_Level_Design
Low level design APPROACH:

Understand the Problem: Break it into pieces.
Identify Objects: List real-world entities and their actions
Define Relationships: Figure out how objects interact
Start Simple: Build a minimal working version, then enhance it.
Apply Patterns (Optional): Use interfaces or abstraction when flexibility is needed—not always upfront.
Iterate: Fix gaps (e.g., concurrency) as they’re spotted or asked.

Total Time Breakdown
5 min: Clarify requirements and sketch entities.
10 min: Design core classes (no interfaces yet).
15 min: Code a working solution.
10 min: Enhance (e.g., concurrency, errors) and test verbally.
5 min: Wrap up, discuss trade-offs.
